# Biography

Hi. I am a PhD student in the Thurley Lab - Systems biology of chronic inflammation. We use mathematical tools, such as stochastic and ODE models to describe and understand inflammatory processes. In collaboration with our experimental partners we analyze high-dimensional data to annotate and validate our models. My focus lies on cellular decision making, especially the communication between T helper cells.
